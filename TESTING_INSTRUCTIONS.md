# Streamlined Authentication & Weather System Setup

## Database Cleanup

1. **Clean existing data in Supabase SQL Editor:**
   ```sql
   -- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to remove all existing data
   -- Order matters: delete child tables before parent tables
   DELETE FROM audit_logs;
   DELETE FROM recommendations;
   DELETE FROM crops_history;
   DELETE FROM farms;
   DELETE FROM farmers;
   
   -- Verify cleanup
   SELECT 'audit_logs' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM audit_logs
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'farmers' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM farmers
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'farms' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM farms  
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'recommendations' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM recommendations
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'crops_history' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM crops_history;
   ```

## Testing the New System

### 1. **Register a New User**
   - Use the registration form with real credentials
   - Backend will hash passwords and store in database
   - No mock data - everything comes from Supabase

### 2. **Create Farm Profile**
   - After registration, create a farm profile
   - Select a district (e.g., "Dhanbad", "Bokaro", etc.)
   - Coordinates will auto-populate based on district selection
   - Farm location data is stored in SQL database

### 3. **Weather Data Flow**
   - Weather widget fetches farm location from SQL database
   - Uses real coordinates (not hardcoded Ranchi coordinates)
   - Calls WeatherAPI.com with farmer's actual location
   - No mock weather data fallbacks

### 4. **Test Different Districts**
   - Create farms in different districts
   - Verify weather shows different data for each location
   - Should see actual district names in weather location

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes:
1. **Authentication (`app/api/auth.py`)**:
   - Registration now creates real database records with hashed passwords
   - Login verifies actual credentials against database
   - `/me` endpoint fetches real user data including farm information
   - Removed all mock data and fallbacks

2. **Weather Integration**:
   - Weather API endpoints already use real farm coordinates from SQL
   - Removed all mock weather data from weather service
   - Weather service now throws errors instead of using fallbacks

### Frontend Changes:
1. **Authentication (`frontend/src/services/authService.js`)**:
   - Login fetches real user data from backend
   - Registration gets actual user profile after account creation
   - Removed all mock user objects

2. **Login Component (`frontend/src/pages/Login.js`)**:
   - Removed demo login button
   - Only real authentication allowed

3. **Weather Service (`frontend/src/services/weatherService.js`)**:
   - Removed mock data fallbacks
   - Throws errors when API fails instead of using fake data

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Clean Database**: Run the SQL cleanup script in Supabase
2. **Start Backend**: Ensure weather API key is configured in `.env`
3. **Register New User**: Use registration form with real data
4. **Create Farm Profile**: Select a district and verify coordinates auto-populate
5. **Check Weather**: Verify weather shows for correct location
6. **Test Different Districts**: Create farms in multiple districts to verify location-based weather

## API Configuration Required

Ensure your `.env` file has:
```
WEATHERAPI_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Without the API key, weather requests will fail (no fallback to mock data).
